## What you can find here ?

This is a informative blog and I will be writing so many blog entries in the near future to make you aware of the latest technology.

The thing is you gotta just keep coming here daily and read my posts. I am no perfectionist in this regard, nor I think that I am some special 
personality in this tech field. I just want to share my knowledge with you all people. I will also be making the discussion platform available here
on the website so that you can easily discuss and point out my mistakes if there is any. However I will fully try to minimize that at any cost. 

Happy reading !
I love Jekyll..
