I am a passionate computer science student, currently studying pursuing for a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or I should say currently playing my computer science bachelor's degree. Yep, I define that activity as 'playing' whenever I need to express that it is giving me a joy. Infact alot of us does that.  

# About the Website
Its good to have one website hosted on public servers. And if you have no business to do over the internet, so you can have blog which expose your life to
the outside world. The experience with me about blogging has been nice since I have started blogging. I changed from one host to another and then to another. 
From blogspot to wordpress then to self made websites. Also changed many webhosts from xtreemhost.com to 000webhost.com always trying to find out free webhosts 
in the internet market just because I did not have enough money to invest into this. I am still unemployed, do not have the source of income, thats why always 
trying to find these free webhosts. To host a website you need a domain also, so I have been finding these free domains also from a long time. I had a cz.cc domain
intially but then it had some issues with some social networking websites, so you cannot share these domains in facebook etc. Then I switched to this 000webhost.

Now the situation is that I am hosting my blog here on 000webhost and domain bought from co.cc and using the core, no wordpress, no blogspot, its just the jekyll.
I love it. You can read my post about starting with jekyll if you are interested in creating such a website I have created, it takes no more than a day to fully 
setup your jekyll website and I really like it. 

Well in this website I have thought of putting as much as entries as possible. Everyday I learn something new, so why not share all these learnings with you. There
are small learnings also sometimes, small enough which makes them ineligible to share on the internet. But whenever I learn something new in this beautiful world of
**Computer Science** and I feel like sharing it, I just add a new entry in my blog. 

# What I want to do ?
I want to be so much of things in this computer science world but unfortunately its just too big. I want to learn so many of the languages in the market and do all the tweaking stuff with the softwares, OSs available in the market and a lot more. Just keep hacking and tweaking. Frankly speaking I just want to keep myself satisfied with this computer science stuff and I hope that I won't get satisfied until I become something and reach some height.
