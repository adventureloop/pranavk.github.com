## Pranav Kant

My name is Pranav Kant studying Computer Science at National Institute of Technology Hamirpur. I am an computer freak and like to tweak with computers just for fun or you can say just for time pass. 

I am coder also and know C, C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS and some small stuff. Apart from computers, I also have a passion regarding football. I am an athlete also and have participated in some athletic events in my school time. In collge I spend most of the time in front of the computer screen -- coding, browsing the internet, making new contacts, configuring new softwares, getting aware of new technology and most importantly enjoying when doing all of these.
