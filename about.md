My name is Pranav Kant studying Computer Science at **National Institute of Technology Hamirpur** and will be completing my undergraduate study in 2015. I love computers and like to tweak with computers just for fun or you can say just for time pass. 

I love coding and know C, C++, JAVA, HTML, CSS and some small stuff. Apart from computers, I also have a passion regarding football. I am an athlete also and have participated in some athletic events in my school time. In collge I spend most of the time in front of the computer screen -- coding, browsing the internet, making new contacts, configuring new softwares, getting aware of new technology and most importantly enjoying when doing all of these.

I created this to share my knowledge, thoughts and day to day experience with you. I hope you will be enjoying your visit here by finding knowledgable material on this website. I am also trying to add more interactivity to this website but that will surely take some time since I don't consider this web thing is my primary concern.

### Contact Me

I like to make friends having Computer Science orientation. I like to talk with them about the new technology and get exposure from them. You are most welcome to contact me on facebook, follow me on twitter or on google+ and lot many. I am usually known over the Internet with only few nicknames.
